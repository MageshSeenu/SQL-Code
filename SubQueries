Subqueries			
			
1. Scalar Subquery			
			
A subquery that returns only one value.			
			
Example:			
			
SELECT name, salary			
FROM employees			
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);			
			
2. Correlated Subquery			
			
A subquery that depends on the outer query.			
			
Runs once per row in the outer query.			
			
Example:			
			
sql			
CopyEdit			
SELECT name, salary			
FROM employees e1			
WHERE salary > (			
    SELECT AVG(salary)			
    FROM employees e2			
    WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id			
);			
			
3. IN Subquery			
			
Used to check if a value exists in a list returned by a subquery.			
			
Example:			
			
sql			
CopyEdit			
SELECT name			
FROM employees			
WHERE department_id IN (			
    SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'HR'			
);
